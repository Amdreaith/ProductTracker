I decided to make my own 
# Product Management System 
 It's engineered to manage and track products, featuring editing, deletion,
 product history views, and PDF report printing. It also provides cool 
 analytics graphs for data visualization.

Developed with Lovable and powered by Supabase on the backend,
this project deepened my knowledge of prompting and database
connectivity. Further enhancements involve implementing an admin 
account for comprehensive user control and blocking.
